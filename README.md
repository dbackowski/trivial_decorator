# TrivialDecorator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dbackowski/trivial_decorator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dbackowski/trivial_decorator)

A simple decorator for Rails.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'trivial_decorator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install trivial_decorator

## Usage

#### Writing Decorators

Decorators inherit from TrivialDecorator::Base, live in your app/decorators directory, and are named for the model that they decorate:

```ruby
# app/decorators/user_decorator.rb

class UserDecorator < TrivialDecorator::Base
  def full_name
    first_name + " " + last_name
  end
end
```

#### Accessing helpers

```ruby
# app/decorators/user_decorator.rb

class UserDecorator < TrivialDecorator::Base
  def full_name
    h.content_tag(:strong, first_name + " " + last_name)
  end
end
```

#### Decorating Objects

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb

class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @users = decorate(User.all)
  end
end
```

This will use UserDecorator, if you want to use other decorator, just pass his class name as second param to decorate.

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb

class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @users = decorate(User.all, OtherDecorator)
  end
end
```
